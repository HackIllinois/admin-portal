# HackIllinois Admin Portal

A simple react app that displays registration, RSVP, checkin, and day-of data for HackIllinois.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo from GitHub
```
git clone git@github.com:HackIllinois/admin-portal.git
```

Start the development server
```
yarn start
```
The admin portal was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) so
we'll be using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as our package manager.

The webpage should open, and will automatically update when changes are made to the app.

## Building a Production Version

Building the app is as simple as running

```
yarn build
```

Files will be written to the `build/` directory.
